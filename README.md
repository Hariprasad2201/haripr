<h1 style="color:white">Indian Premier League previous seasons winners and results</center></h1><br>
<h2 style="color:boldgrey">IPL 2021 will be the 14th edition of India's premier T20 league. Indian Premier League was conceptualised after India's landmark victory in the maiden ICC WT20 in 2007. The league came into existence in 2008 with 8 franchises. Since then, IPL has attracted some of the biggest cricketers from all across the globe. It has turned out to be the most watched T20 league in the world and has been a huge money spinner for the BCCI. Mumbai Indians are the most successful team with five titles, and are two-time defending champions going into this year's tournament. Chennai Super Kings, who have been the most consistent team of the league over the years, missed out on a play-off spot last season. MS Dhoni's team would want to erase those memories and add to their three titles this year. IPL has been a great platform for young talent to showcase their skills and rub shoulders with the best players in the world. Players like Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya and Ravichandran Ashwin have all gone on to beome superstars for the Indian cricket team after making a breakthrough in the IPL. The likes of Rishabh Pant, Washington Sundar and the others are continuing the tradition.</h2>
